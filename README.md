WTF - UAH
=======

**W**eb **T**imeout **F**riend for **UAH**!

This addon works to expand the capabilities of UAH's network services. The original timeout tooling for which the software is named no longer applies.

### Usage

This app doesn't work if your browser is closed or you put your computer into standby, sorry.

### Install

*Update:*
You may now get the add-on from mozilla's site! (I think...)
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wtf-uah/

To install manually:

* Download wtf_uah.xpi (you may ignore all other files in this git)
* Type 'about:addons' into the URL bar, hit enter
* At the top of the add-ons page, click menu -> "Install add-on from file"
* Select wtf_uah.xpi, restart firefox, go get werk done!
